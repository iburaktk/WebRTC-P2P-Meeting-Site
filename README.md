## Introduction

This project is a meeting site that uses peer-to-peer socket connection provided by WebRTC PeerJS framework.

### WebRTC

With [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org), you can add real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard. It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers. 

The technology is available on all modern browsers as well as on native clients for all major platforms. The technologies behind WebRTC are implemented as an open web standard and available as regular JavaScript APIs in all major browsers. For native clients, like Android and iOS applications, a library is available that provides the same functionality. 

The WebRTC project is open-source and supported by Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla, amongst others.
